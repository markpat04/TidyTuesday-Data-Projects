# R Data Analysis Portfolio: TidyTuesday Projects

### üìä Data Analysis and Visualization Projects

This repository serves as a professional portfolio, showcasing my skills in **R programming** and the **tidyverse** ecosystem. Each folder contains a complete analysis project based on data from the weekly **#TidyTuesday** challenge, demonstrating a commitment to continuous learning and application of data science techniques.

---

### üí°Key Skills Demonstrated

The projects within this repository showcase expertise in the following areas:

* **Data Wrangling:** Using `dplyr` and `tidyr` for cleaning, transformation, and manipulation of raw datasets.
* **Data Visualization:** Creating insightful and communicative graphics using `ggplot2` and various extension packages.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying patterns, and hypotheses through systematic data exploration.
* **Modeling & Statistical Analysis:** (When applicable) Building models (`{modelr}`, `{broom}`) to extract underlying patterns and communicate findings.
* **Reproducibility:** All projects are fully reproducible, integrating code, results, and narrative using **R Markdown**.
