# TidyTuesday-Data-Projects

### üìä Portfolio of Data Analysis and Visualization Projects

This repository serves as a professional portfolio, showcasing my skills in **R programming** and the **tidyverse** ecosystem. Each folder contains a complete analysis project based on data from the weekly **#TidyTuesday** challenge, demonstrating a commitment to continuous learning and application of data science techniques.

### Key Skills Demonstrated

The projects within this repository showcase expertise in the following areas:

* **Data Wrangling:** Using `dplyr` and `tidyr` for cleaning, transformation, and manipulation of raw datasets.
* **Data Visualization:** Creating insightful and communicative graphics using `ggplot2` and various extension packages.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying patterns, anomalies, and hypotheses through systematic data exploration.
* **Modeling & Statistical Analysis:** (When applicable) Building simple linear models (`{modelr}`, `{broom}`) to extract underlying patterns and communicate findings.
* **Reproducibility:** All projects are fully reproducible, integrating code, results, and narrative using **R Markdown**.

### üìÇ Project Structure

Each project is organized into its own dedicated folder, named by the year and date of the challenge (e.g., `2024_W01`).

| Folder Naming Convention | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `2024_W01` | **Year** (2024) and **Week** (01). |

A typical project folder contains:

* `README.md`: A brief summary of the project's data, research questions, and key findings.
* `analysis.Rmd`: The complete R Markdown file containing the code and narrative.
* `final_plot.png`: The final, high-resolution graphic for quick viewing.
